            <b>ISNA Online Matrimonial website</b> is powered, monitored, and
            maintained by the Islamic Society of North America (ISNA). This
            service is designed to provide a convenient way to its members to
            interact with one another on the Web. To accomplish this, our
            members create their profiles and our matching search capability
            provides them matches based on their pre-selected criteria. Personal
            member information in this database cannot be used by the public
            (site visitors), other members, or anyone not employed by ISNA.
          </p>
          <p>
            We are a subscription-based service. We collect credit card,
            address, or bank information when members choose to subscribe to our
            fee-based services.

            Information submitted to ISNA Matrimonials
          </h4>{" "}
          There are two types of user-submitted information we collect: Public
          and Private.
          <p>
            <b>Public</b> information is defined as information that may be
            displayed on the site, such as gender, age, height etc. but cannot
            be linked to a particular user.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Private</b> information is defined as personal information such
            as name, address, email, phone number, credit card information, and
            any other contact information.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Public:</b> To accomplish our goal of bringing compatible people
            together, we must gather information, which may or may not include
            customer-specified ISNA Matrimonials username, gender, age, ethnic
            background, appearance, school of thought, income range, occupation,
            and general geographic location. Much of this information is
            optional, and meant to be seen by members and visitors to the site
            but cannot be used to identify a specific member by name, address,
            etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Private:</b> This information is gathered from members and
            visitors who apply for the various services our site offers.
          </p>
          <p>
            This information includes, but is not limited to: email address,
            first name, last name, birth date, credit card number or checking
            account information for payment, a user-specified password, mailing
            address, zip code and telephone number.

            Use of Information Obtained by ISNA Matrimonials
          </h4>
          <p>Information users submit to ISNA Matrimonials.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Public:</b> Public information supplied by the user is intended
            to be viewed by visitors to the site. Visitors for searching and
            matching purposes use this information. Public information cannot be
            used to identify a specific member by name, address, etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Private:</b> We primarily use email addresses submitted by
            members to verify enrollment and when forwarding anonymous e-mails
            from ad responders. Email addresses are not disclosed to the
            responder. We may also use email of a user to send news
            regarding our site or events, but the user may choose not to receive
            email of this type by contacting us. Email addresses may also be
            used in private correspondence with the user for customer service
            issues. Financial information that is collected is used to bill the
            user for products and services. All other private information
            submitted by the user is confidential and will not be disclosed
            except as required by law or to protect members of ISNA
            Matrimonials. All private information can be updated or deleted by
            the user at any time.

            ISNA Matrimonials gives users several options for modifying or
            removing their profile information from our database at any time.
            Please use the Edit My Profile button to make any changes. If you

          <p>
            ISNA Matrimonials takes every precaution to protect our users
            information. When users submit sensitive information via the
            website, your information is protected both online and off-line.
            When our registration/order process asks users to enter sensitive
            information, (such as a credit card number) that information is
            encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the
            industry - SSL. While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive
            information online, we also do everything in our power to protect
            user information off-line. All of our users information, not just
            the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our
            offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a
            specific job (for example a billing clerk or a customer service
            representative) are granted access to personally identifiable
            information. If you have any questions about the security at our
            website, please contact us.
