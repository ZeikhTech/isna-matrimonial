                  The Qur’an not only provides a romantic image, but also
                  reveals practical ways to achieve this ideal by explaining how
                  believers should conduct their personal affairs and
                  relationships.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Qur’an highlights certain qualities as characteristics of
                  believers, qualities that are important in ensuring healthy
                  relationships with others, such as being patient, just,
                  honest, trustworthy, generous, kind, humble, and
                  compassionate.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Qur’an uses romantic, beautiful, and spiritual language
                  when describing the creation of man and woman and their
                  relationship as spouses to inspire us to realize its lofty
                  ideals. God tells us that “among His signs is this, that He
                  created for you mates from among yourselves, that you may
                  dwell in tranquility (sakinah) with them, and He has put love
                  (mawaddah) and mercy (rahmah) between your (hearts)…” (30:21).
                  The image generated here, one of peacefulness, comfort, and
                  warmth, also defines marriage as normative, one of God’s
                  signs, and part of the lifestyle that He wants for His
                  creation. Such a depiction is certainly encouraging and
                  hopeful for those contemplating marriage.
                </p>
                <p>
                  But how do Muslims bring this beautiful image to life in their
                  own lives? The sakinah mentioned eludes many Muslim, who find
                  their marriage fraught with conflict and disharmony. Couples
                  in marriage counseling often express their disappointment and
                  frustration with unmet expectations and shattered dreams;
                  feelings of being misunderstood, unappreciated, unloved, and
                  insignificant; and, sometimes, how their spouses oppress and
                  abuse them. At times, it seems that both separation and
                  divorce are becoming epidemic among Muslims.

                  The Qur’an not only provides a romantic image, but also
                  reveals practical ways to achieve this ideal by explaining how
                  believers should conduct their personal affairs and
                  relationships. This general guidance should form the basis for
                  how spouses treat each other. In addition to the Qur’an, the
                  Sunnah of the Prophet (salla Allahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) shows
                  Muslims how to prepare for marriage, choose the right spouse,
                  conduct the marriage ceremony, manage conflict, and even end
                  the marriage when necessary. To understand the Islamic
                  paradigm of marriage, it is useful to look at the creation
                  story. God created us “from a single soul, and from that soul,
                  created its mate” (4:1). In other words, He created men and
                  women as inherently equal, for they come from the same
                  substance. Recognizing this equality is critical for a proper
                  understanding of the spousal relationship. Many Muslim couples
                  have forgotten their divine origin, which has frequently
                  enabled men to become the “superior” partner and usurp more
                  authority than what is needed to establish and then maintain a
                  healthy and mutually satisfying relationship. God created
                  women and men for the same purpose: to worship Him. Each human
                  being has the role of khalifah (vicegerent) on Earth, which
                  consists of living according to the divine will and
                  implementing God’s teachings. God outlines the independent
                  relationship that each person has with Him and informs us that
                  He watches, holds accountable, and rewards each person
                  according to his/her deeds, according to the underlying
                  intentions.

                  It is no accident that men and women are different: “O
                  humanity, We created you from a single (pair) of a male and a
                  female and made you into nations and tribes that you may know
                  each other (not that you may despise each other). Verily the
                  most honored of you in God’s sight is the most righteous (one)
                  of you. God has full knowledge and is well acquainted (with
                  all things)”(49:13). Even though God made each human being
                  from the same substance, He deliberately created each gender
                  with unique attributes. Contemporary authors and researchers
                  have spent a great deal of effort and energy to understand the
                  different ways in which men and women communicate, think,
                  emote, and behave. Sometimes these differences lead to
                  challenges in relationships, with spouses feeling that they
                  are from different planets. Understanding these differences
                  can lead to an appreciation of what each spouse contributes to
                  the marriage as well as insights into what each one values and
                  needs most.
