            The ISNA Matrimonial Site is for the personal use of individual
            members only, and may not be used in connection with any commercial
            endeavors. This includes providing links to other websites, whether

            companies, and/or businesses may not become Members of ISNA
            Matrimonial and should not use the ISNA Matrimonial Service or Site
            for any purpose. Illegal and/or unauthorized uses of the Site,

          <h4 className="font-weight-bold mb-0">Membership Categories</h4>
          <p>
            Users of the Service may use minimal service as Guests (Public
            Users) or become Trial Members or <b>Deluxe Members</b> of the Service.
            Guests are allowed access to a minimal level of the Service
            features. Trial Members are allowed to access more features of the
            Service than are Guests, but are not allowed access to all of the
            features that Deluxe Members are allowed to access. Trial Members
            are not charged by us for the features they can access. Deluxe
            Members are provided with access to additional features of the
            Service that are not available to Guests or Trial Members. Certain
            features of the Service are paid features, for which a Deluxe
            Member is charged.
          </p>
          <h4 className="font-weight-bold mb-0">Fees and Payments</h4>
          <p>
            a. Deluxe Members of the Service are required to purchase the
            membership on monthly, quarterly, or semiannual basis. Each month is
            considered as 30 days of length, any one paying in February will get
            the same amount of days of premium membership as the person who is
            paying in a month with 31 days. Similarly 3 months membership is
            considered as 90 days membership and one year as 360 days.
          </p>
          <p>
            b. The Deluxe member has an option to turn off or on his/her
            auto-renew feature any time after the first payment is made, through
            the Account Settings option.
          </p>
          <p>
            c. If we find that any member has used a stolen or fraudulent credit
            card the personal information of that member will be forwarded to
            the Law enforcement agencies of the resident country of the member.
          </p>
          <p>
            d. Most subscription plans to the Service consist of an initial
            period, for which there is a onetime charge, followed by recurring
            period charges as agreed to by you. By entering into this Agreement,
            you acknowledge that your subscription has an initial and recurring
            payment feature and you accept responsibility for all recurring
            charges prior to cancellation. ISNA MATRIMONIAL MAY SUBMIT PERIODIC
            CHARGES (e.g., MONTHLY) WITHOUT FURTHER AUTHORIZATION FROM YOU,
            UNTIL YOU PROVIDE PRIOR NOTICE (CONFIRMED IN WRITING UPON REQUEST BY
            ISNA MATRIMONIAL) THAT YOU HAVE TERMINATED THIS AUTHORIZATION OR
            WISH TO CHANGE YOUR PAYMENT METHOD. SUCH NOTICE WILL NOT AFFECT
            CHARGES SUBMITTED BEFORE ISNA MATRIMONIAL REASONABLY COULD ACT. TO
            TERMINATE YOUR AUTHORIZATION OR CHANGE YOUR PAYMENT METHOD, GO TO
            MEMBERSHIP SETTINGS.
